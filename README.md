An analysis is contained fatal shooting by police in each age group- The csv files have not tracked deaths of people in police custody,fatal shootings by off-duty officers or non-shootings deaths.

About the data
The file fatal-police-shootings-data.csv contains data about each of the fatal shootings in csv format and I have break down victims in 6 age group, and filter by gender, violence level and victims rate in city types.

        
 Break down
 (1) divided victims in 6 age group, then calculate total amount of victims by gender
 (2) Determine which gender has the most total victims. As result, male gender take place for the most total victims.
 (3) Calculate the total of victim threat level(Attack, Others, Undetermined) in each group age, attack violence took place in the most victim threat level
 (4) Since we know most victims are come from male gender, we would like to determine the total number of male victims with attack violence, and compare the percentage in total victims and just total victims in male gender
 (5) Calculate the total victims rate in city types (Rural, Suburban, Urban)in each group age, suburban took place for in the city type
 (6) Since we know most victims are come from male gender, we would like to determine the total number of male victims in suburban, and compare the percentage in total victims and just total victims in male gender
