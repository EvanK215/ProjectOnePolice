## Analysis of Fatal Police Shootings in US based on State wise 
# Fatal shootings between 2015 and 2020

An analysis on only shootings in which a police officer ,in the line of duty ,shoots and kills a civillian - The csv files have not tracked deaths of people in police custody,fatal shootings by off-duty officers or non-shootings deaths.

# About the data
The file fatal-police-shootings-data.csv contains data about each of the fatal shootings in csv format and I have taken data about the population in each state from worldpopulationreview.com where it contains total population 
of each race in each state .

# Observable Trends 

* 684 fatal shootings occurred in CA which consist of approximately 14% of all shootings. THe top 3 states in terms of total number of shootings are in California ,Texas and Florida

* The ratio for black people (B) is clearly higher than other races. The native (N) and other (O) have very low population so a more logical comparison would be among black (B), white (W), hispanic (H), and asian (A) races.
The ratio of deaths_per_million for black(B) people is double the ratio of hispanic(H)people . The diffrence between black(B) and White(W) people are even more.
