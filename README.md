# ProjectOnePolice

Cristina Sheridan
My portion of project one involved a year trend for police shootings by race.
Also for year 2019 I looked at proportions of shootings per race compared to the proportions of races out of the population.
The data showed that black people are disproportionately targeted in comparison to other races.
