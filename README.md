Team Members - Cristina Sheridan, Evan Kamis, Poyuan Han, Roshini Jayantha

# Project Description/Outline:
For this project we utilized data from multiple resources which was collected from Washigton Post , Census Beureau , Kaggle and MappingPoliceViolence.com . We chose to look at the correlation between race and total no of people shot by police in major US states and police shootings of race over time

# Research Questions to Answer
1. In which state the total no deaths due to police shootings was highest?
2. What were the age group of the people shot by police in each state? 
3. Which race is affected the most in the top 4 states in terms of total number of deaths ?
4. Is there any continuous upward or downward trend in the daily number of shootings from 2015 to 2020
